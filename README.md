mGDP
====

MATLAB tools for accessing Geo Data Portal functionality.

Check out the examples folder for an example of using the mGDP object to grab driver data from NOAA's NARR dataset (North American regional reanalysis). The feature for processing is a public shapefile hosted at sciencebase.gov

mGDP doesn't currently use the upload shapefile that can be found in pyGDP (github.com/USGS-CIDA/pyGDP). I am working on using mGDP to trigger sciencebase services for this functionality instead.
